History of math is full of moments when brilliant minds, whose names glorify some of the most tremendous achievements in science, could not withstand the perplexities of real life. Either because of short temper or by poor luck, more often than not the fates of mathematicians took to the dangerous and occasionally fatal roads. French mathematician Galois, who single-handedly solved a 350-years standing problem of finding solutions in radicals to any-degree polynomial and founded a group theory,  died at the age of 20! And guess because of what?.. He died in a duel. The world lost probably the most promising scientist at the time so early because it was morally accepted to solve daily problems with the guns. Or Polish mathematician Stefan Banach who proved one of the most fundamental results in mathematics called fixed point theorem (https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08416) and coined his name in Banach-Tarski paradox, had to be a lice feeder (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeder_of_lice) during the Nazi occupancy of Lwów. Take a list of the most important works in mathematics (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_Created_the_Integers) and count how many of the authors had something terrible happening in their lives; at times it seems like a necessity to become really prolific researcher.

One would not dare to call the lives of Weisfeiler (1941-1985) and Lehman (1940-2012) easy or smooth. Looking at their stories you understand how you can put your plans to the box that you will never open because the life has its own views. I could not find much information about their lives online, although I was able to find directly people who knew these two mathematicians. Below is the description of this story.

In 2017 I started studying different methods for graph isomorphism in particular for graph classification problem (eventually culminating with the paper at ICML (https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11921)) I stumbled upon an algorithm that was both relatively simple and fast, It is called Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/shervashidze11a/shervashidze11a.pdf). Shortly, the algorithm attempts to give nodes different colors, iteratively improving colors such that if after some iterations two graphs have different colorings then they are not isomorphic. Subsequently I learned that this method had a big impact on the graph isomorphism method even though there are simple pairs of graphs where it does not work (https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/102062/26441). At some point I was searching for a citation of this paper and found that both Weisfeiler and Lehman were Soviet mathematicians and studied in the universities that I know well and even attended at some point of my past. Suddenly many things have become common and familiar to me. I started reading more about their lives, where they studied and how did they come up with an algorithm, and eventually to what happened to them. I share these two biographies of Boris Weisfeiler and Andrei Lehman, two different paths that intersected for some time and then moved away in completely different directions.

Boris Weisfeiler
Boris was born in Moscow, USSR, in 1941, but soon with a family they moved to Ekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk back then), USSR. His father was a professor in microbiology and his mother was a doctor, with a younger sister Olga. His father was born in Hungary but immigrated to USSR in 1932, while a mother moved from Minsk to Moscow, where she received a PhD in medicine. He got always interested in outdoor activities, hiking and skiing, a passion that would later play a big role in his life. It was way to relax, he often hiked alone and was very reserved man. Igor Faradjev, his companion in one of his hikes, said they just exchanged a dozen of words during one and a half month route in the Siberia, because there was just no need.
Always talented in math, he graduated with a PhD in 1969 in Leningrad, one of the best places to study math in Soviet Union. That path was not easy though. He had his thesis almost ready in 1963, but expelled from his university after he refused to sign a document against his Jewish colleague. Even after his Doctorate degree his academic life encountered many challenges: he could not go abroad to the conference and to the father, who by then immigrated to Budapest, his office desk was searched during his absence. Plus the overall antisemitism mood that was present in the academia didn’t help. That led to the point when Boris decided to emigrate, knowing that there is no path back to the country. By the summer 1975 he landed in Chicago, Illinois.

In two months he started a new position as a assistant professor at Princeton, New Jersey, where he finally could do what he wanted to do, math. He published a well-known monograph in algebraic topology, taught students in the university, traveled in US and abroad with lectures, and did a lot of research in his field. In 1981 he obtained US citizenship and was able to visit his family in Budapest. Life seemed to get better finally, at least for some time.

Boris continued doing hiking in the US, although his locations changed. Instead of lakes and mountains in Ural he now went to Chilean Andes, where he wanted “to wander, relax and not see anyone”. Unfortunately, this trip has become the last one known about Boris -- he disappeared. In 1985 Chile was under a dictator Augusto Pinochet (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusto_Pinochet) known for violation of many human rights. The official version of Chilean government reports that Weisfeiler was boating in a swift-moving river, where he accidentally drowned. Some locals say they gave him direction to follow the river towards the bridge close to Colonia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_Dignidad), a lair for German Nazi after WWII. Weisfeiler’s Jewish origins could be a reason of kidnapping by the group of fascism expatriates who settled in a large territory of South America. His sister Olga continues to investigate the disappearance of Boris Weisfeiler, after in 2000 declassified US documents were stating that he was abducted by the Chilean military. There is a website (http://boris.weisfeiler.com/) created by Olga and her family to update on the status of the Weisfeiler case. After 34 years disappearance of Weisfeiler still remains unknown.

Andrei Lehman
Early on, Andrei was showing big talent in math with being one of the winners of national math Olympiads. His passion to resolve hard mathematical challenges determined his way of thinking for the rest of his life. He was not as much interested in abstract concepts as Weisfeiler, but was a good programmer and a good mathematician to merge these two disciplines together. In 1971 he attempted to defend his PhD thesis on enumeration of all cellular algebras and associative schemes of small order. After many tensions from the Academic officials who constantly were interrogating lives of mathematicians, especially with Jewish origins, he ceased to deal with algebras and focused on programming. In 1973 he wrote a new thesis on database systems, which became the first Soviet Union database. Lehman was very versatile programmer, helping on the range of problems from simulating quantum effects to developing first world champion in chess games.

These skills helped him later on when he immigrated to Silicon Valley, where remained to be a programmer, working in different startups. Together with Igor Faradjev, who also moved to the USA, they started working in Cognitive Technology Inc on optical recognition systems. His last company was Invitae, where continued to work as a programmer until he passed away at the age of 72. His friends remember him as a reliable and loyal person with a strong sense of humor and a talent in math.
